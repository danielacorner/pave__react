todo:
- legends!!
- tune subskill filter limits to be less excessive
- sort by size should be smoother (turn off other forces?)
- colour by salary, study (togglegroup? or dropdown + toggle?)
- legends
- scatterplot
- change sizes?
- change colours?

feature: tooltips

bug: filtering in colour-sorted mode shouldn't restart the simulation x,y forces

Fancy Up the Visuals
- transition circles on enter (attrtween?) with delay
- transition reset filters button
- smooth out the bouncy reset force after filtering
