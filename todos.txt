TODOS:

todo:
- y axis scale on handleResize
- add more typescript
- customize legend based on settingsContext

- save favourites to localstorage
- remove the most bottom circle legend
- legend for colours (study/salary/risk)
- find dataset for NLP
- tooltip cards? https://material-ui.com/demos/cards/
- NLP for related jobs
- more datasets! https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch
  - jobs in high demand
  - soft skills and correlated jobs
  - more modern job categories
- add downshift https://material-ui.com/demos/autocomplete/
- desktop tooltip click to expand https://material-ui.com/demos/expansion-panels/ (turn off bottomsheet)
- tabs for different analysis modes https://material-ui.com/demos/tabs/
- menu for tooltip action items (favourite, related jobs...)
- snake oil supplements single y-axis to start
- bottom navigation for mobile graph mode?
- disable synchronized sliders
- feedback form
- filters should be coloured upwards? (reversed, start filled, drag right to empty)
- add more info to bottomsheet tooltip (links...)
- fix resize/translate function when size-sorted (circles shouldn't overlap container)
- sort by type could be more spaced-out on mobile
- tune subskill filter limits to be less excessive
- clean up code
- scatterplot?
- consider adding setTimeout to FORCE sort functions to increase collision (or repel) force (to spread out circles after transitions)

bug: filtering in colour-sorted mode shouldn't restart the simulation x,y forces

Fancy Up the Visuals
- transition circles on enter (attrtween?) with delay
- transition reset filters button
- smooth out the bouncy reset force after filtering
