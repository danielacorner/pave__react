feature: sort by sizes
bug: filtering in colour-sorted mode shouldn't restart the simulation x,y forces

feature: bar graph showing average salary, years of study
bug: prevent bar graph showing before filtered, and after reset

extract contextprovider functions into their respective component folders

debug filter slider click (filters state actually changes, but should only visually change (change slider position, but don't change filter state))

stop the simulation on slider click, restart simulation on mouseup (improve performance)


add circle-pack (grab from pave-angular)

improve speed

radius dropdown
cluster dropdown
static viz
sort sizes button
sort clusters button

Fancy Up the Visuals
- transition circles on enter (attrtween?) with delay
- transition reset filters button
- smooth out the bouncy reset force after filtering
