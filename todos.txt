todo:
- sort by type could be more spaced-out on mobile
- tune subskill filter limits to be less excessive
- clean up code
- scatterplot
- change sizes?
- consider adding setTimeout to FORCE sort functions to increase collision (or repel) force (to spread out circles after transitions)


feature: tooltips

bug: filtering in colour-sorted mode shouldn't restart the simulation x,y forces

Fancy Up the Visuals
- transition circles on enter (attrtween?) with delay
- transition reset filters button
- smooth out the bouncy reset force after filtering
