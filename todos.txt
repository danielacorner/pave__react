TODOS:
Title
“Goodjob: Explore Canadian Careers”
One-line instructions above filters
Adjust the skill level controls to filter your search. Click/hover over a circle to see a result.
Filter slider: how to tell what's big vs small
Add "skills" to the ends of each category
Percents? Of what?
Min and max
Tooltips:
Filter expand-more buttons
Sort toggle buttons
Risk/Salary/Study menu items
Legend for colours (study/salary/risk)
To-do for Trello - Remove the most bottom circle legend



todo:
- add pop-up mobile tooltip to desktop on click
- add more info to mobile tooltip (links...)
- sort by type could be more spaced-out on mobile
- tune subskill filter limits to be less excessive
- clean up code
- scatterplot
- change sizes?
- consider adding setTimeout to FORCE sort functions to increase collision (or repel) force (to spread out circles after transitions)


bug: filtering in colour-sorted mode shouldn't restart the simulation x,y forces

Fancy Up the Visuals
- transition circles on enter (attrtween?) with delay
- transition reset filters button
- smooth out the bouncy reset force after filtering
